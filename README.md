# Airline Data Analysis using Python
## Skills - Python, Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Visualization

This project explores **airline pricing patterns and trends** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques. The primary objective was to identify key pricing factors and uncover actionable insights from flight data.

🔍 **Key Analysis Areas:**

- Does the **time of day** (morning, afternoon, evening) impact flight prices?
- Which **airlines** have the **highest and lowest average prices**?
- Are certain **routes (Source → Destination)** more expensive than others?
- Which **airports** are the busiest in terms of flight volume?
- How do **stops, duration, and additional services** influence flight pricing?

🛠️ **Techniques & Tools Used:**

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized columns  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted and created new variables like time blocks, duration in minutes, and stop categories  
- **Data Visualization:** Used Python libraries for visual insights

📚 **Libraries:**

- `Pandas` for data manipulation  
- `NumPy` for numerical operations  
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization

📊 **Key Insights Discovered:**

- Flights during certain times of day tend to be more expensive  
- Some routes and airlines consistently show higher pricing  
- Airlines with more stopovers often charge less  
- Major airports account for a significantly larger portion of traffic  

🎯 **Skills Gained:**

- Real-world **EDA techniques** on complex datasets  
- **Feature engineering** to improve analytical depth  
- **Data visualization** to communicate insights effectively  
- Strengthened proficiency in **Python libraries** like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- Built an insight-driven foundation for **predictive modeling** in future work
